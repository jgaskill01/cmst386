      <h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>
      <p>
        Search engines used automated programs called "crawlers" to comb through
        billions of web page documents through their links and record the data
        from their metatags in huge servers. When a user enters a search query
        into the engine, results are rendered based on relevance of the user's
        search to results, and popularity. This is how a search engine like
        google creates an order with which to display results.

      <h2>The Importance of Keywords and Descriptions as Metatags</h2>
      <p>
        Metatags are a shortened summary or set of keywords that, when given to
        a user, will determine whether or not a particular site will be entered
        or not, based on the user's needs. Metatags like the HTML title tag and
        meta descriptions are what a search engine will show a user when the
        site is returned as a result, with the title being what the search
        engine returns as the site's title, and meta description being the
        little blurb under the title. Meta keywords are another element used by
        the search engine to find the site based on a user's search.

      <h2>The Four Elements that Comprise Writing Relevant Content Links</h2>
      <p>
        You can link to just about any content on a website, but one of the most
        useful is an image. This is because linking so an image source is much
        less risky, copyright-wise, than just copying someone else's work onto
        your site. Additionally, one can link to a video. Almost any multimedia
        can be linked to on a webpage in similar fashion: Anchor tags! But you
        can link more than just images and videos. A web developer's best friend
        is linking to other content using hyper-linked text (again using anchor
        tags). Another type of content you can link to is outside content that
        either further explains a topic, or maybe gives an example of an
        existing subject, such as if I made a site about dinosaurs, but linked
        to a specific outside page about a particular species of dinosaur.
        Finally, a web developer can create a link that takes the user to an
        email message draft to whoever you want! You can use the mailto: command
        to link to your business email address on your official blog, for
        instance.

      <h2>What is Good Heading Hierarchy?</h2>
      <p>
        Good heading heirarchy is import to the web designer and developer for
        both Search Engine Optimization and just general readability for the
        website. While heading content has not been used by most search engines
        to rank content for some time, their primary function now is to simply
        tell the search engine what the site's content is about. Since headings
        should be used as titles of cooresponding content, they are valuable to
        a search engine to identify where in a particular website it should send
        the user. In general, good heading heirarchy should follow common sense
        rules: h1 should be the title of the overall topic, and h2 through h6
        should coorespond to a nested content logic. So, if a site is about
        dinosaurs, good heading heirarchy would look like this:
