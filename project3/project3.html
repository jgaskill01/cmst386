    <!--link rel="stylesheet" href="/project3/css/project3.scss" I implemented SASS by downloading a plugin from node.js
    that compiles the SAS file into CSS on the server side before hosting to the client. It creates a folder that shows the build 
  info, and keeps the source SASS folder in the /css folder alonside the generated CSS.-->

          Responsive design is the building of websites that can change their
          layout and appearance based on what size their browser or viewing window
          is. Typically, this is decided by the size of the screen. In practice,
          there are usally three sizes used, and they are mobile phone, tablet,
          and desktop. Many users in the modern day do not have a desktop computer
          at all, while some have tablets, and most have mobile phones. It is only
          natural, then, that we as developers cater to the largest audience
          first, which is mobile. But our websites need also be able to change
          format based on the user using a tablet or computer to maximize the
          user's viewing efficiency and aesthetic value. Additionally, mobile
          friendly sites are often front-loaded in terms of SEO.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Events Report:</strong> This report shows how many times every
              event is triggered by how many users. This is a tool that's value is
              found in its ability to show which parts of your site are receiving
              the least traffic and why, and the most traffic and why.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pages and Screen report:</strong> This report tracks how long
              a website was in focus on a browser or device, how many times a
              conversion event was triggered, the number of events, total revenue,
              number of views and on which screens, views per user, and number of
              users. This tool is valuable because you can use it to look at trends
              in total time spent on the site, as well as the distribution of screen
              sizes most often used to access it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retention Overview Report:</strong> This report is more of a
              long term tool that explores the interaction of users across more than
              one visit. For instance, if a user buys something and then something
              else a week later, that will be a positive event tracked across a
              graph, to show users are returning after their initial transactions
              You can even group the users by when they visited, so that if you make
              a change, you can see only those users whose initial vist was after
              that change to measure its efficacy.
