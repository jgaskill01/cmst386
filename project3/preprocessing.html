				<strong>Client Side</strong>
				<p>Client Side preprocessing means that the LESS or SASS is transformed into CSS 
				on the client side, using either a JavaScript tool like Sass.js or Less.js, or any tool
				that is in the HTML file of the page and runs in the browser. Client side preprocessing can be 
				used with any browser.	
				</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Server Side</strong> 
				<p>Server-side preprocessing means the LESS or SASS is transformed to CSS  on the server side to 
					BEFORE it gets to the client browser. This can be done using tools such as Sass or Less that are 
					installed on the web server, which is more efficient than client-side preprocessing overall, while losing
					some of the universal usability.</p>

			<h1>Elements of SASS / LESS</h1>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Mix-Ins</strong>
				<p>Mi-Ins allow the user to define code that will be reused and tag it with the 
					@mixin directive, included by using @include. Valuable time saver for things like typography
					and layouts.
				</p></li>
				<li><strong>Variables</strong>
				<p>Variables allows the user to assign common values that will be reused, such as colors and fonts.
					Variables are defined using @variable and referenced anywhere in the stylesheet.
				</p></li>
				<li><strong>Functions</strong>
				<p>Functions allow the user to create instructions that are reused, such as calulations, transforms,
					and conversions. Defined using the @function directive and called from in the style sheet.
				</p></li>
				<li><strong>Operators</strong>
				<p>
				Operators allow the user to complete math calculations within a style sheet. This seems simple, but when sheets get complex, 
					it simplifies the maintenance process. A great example is an alternative way to do media queries.
					For instance, one could use an if statement to look at if the width of an element is > than a certain pixel amount, the media will
					behave a certain way. This method of doing that would not be possible without operators.</p></li>
			
				<li><strong>Nested Variables</strong>
				<p>Nested variables are another tool that reduces code complexity and length, and increases code readability, organization,
					and improves ease of maintenance. By allowing the user to program in certain values like '$color-primary: #12345', 
				and time that value is plugged in, that value will manifest. Now, if the user wants to change the value of $color-primary, 
			it will automatically change in any place $color-primary is called. This is how nesting the variable saves time.  </p></li>
