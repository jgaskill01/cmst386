            <strong>Client Side</strong>
			<p>Client Side preprocessing means that the LESS or SASS is transformed into CSS 
			on the client side, using either a JavaScript tool like Sass.js or Less.js, or any tool
			that is in the HTML file of the page and runs in the browser. Client side preprocessing can be 
			used with any browser.	
			</p>
          </li>

            <strong>Server Side</strong> 
			<p>Server-side preprocessing means the LESS or SASS is transformed to CSS  on the server side to 
				BEFORE it gets to the client browser. This can be done using tools such as Sass or Less that are 
				installed on the web server, which is more efficient than client-side preprocessing overall, while losing
			    some of the universal usability.</p>

			<li><strong>Mix-Ins</strong>
			<p>Mi-Ins allow the user to define code that will be reused and tag it with the 
				@mixin directive, included by using @include. Valuable time saver for things like typography
				and layouts.
			</p></li><br>
			<li><strong>Variables</strong></li>
			<p>Variables allows the user to assign common values that will be reused, such as colors and fonts.
				Variables are defined using @variable and referenced anywhere in the stylesheet.
			</p>
			<br><li><strong>Functions</strong></li>
			<p>Functions allow the user to create instructions that are reused, such as calulations, transforms,
			    and conversions. Defined using the @function directive and called from in the style sheet.
			</p>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Operators</strong></li>
			<p>Operators allow the user to complete math calculations</p>
